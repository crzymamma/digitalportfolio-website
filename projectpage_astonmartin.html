                <h2>Speed Design: Aston Martin Web Facelift</h2>
                <div class="project-section">
                    <h4>For a fun design exercise, I wanted to see what I could do to give Aston Martin's website a facelift in just a couple of hours.</h4>
                    <p>The goal here was to observe how small changes to the design system and layout could vastly improve the user experience. While Aston Martin is a strong, innovative brand, their current website suffers from outdated design elements and a layout that gives way to <span class="bold">horror vacui</span>.</p>

                    <img src="aston_webold_notes.jpg" alt="">
                    <h4>Challenges</h4>
                    <p>Concerning design elements, the <span class="bold">buttons and nav style</span> stuck out to me the most. The dark yet transparent background for the navigation looked out of place. <span class="bold">The grey, blocky buttons</span> stuck on top of this background were especially outdated and didn't match the flat Aston Martin logo to their left.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, the overall layout was very <span class="bold">video-heavy</span> and didn't allow for enough <span class="bold">breathing space</span>. This made scrolling the website feel claustrophobic.</p>
                    <p>Overall, the design language of Aston Martin's website felt inconsistent and not representative of their luxury brand.</p>

                <div class="project-section">
                    <h4>Design Solution</h4>
                    <p>Since the website is mostly made up of pictures, and since I was on a time limit, I decided to jump right into hi-fi by creating a layout for the index page as well as some basic components that I would use throughout it.</p>
                    <p>When creating the layout for the index page, my main focus was giving the user more space between large images and videos. In order to achieve this, I both reorganized existing elements as well as redesigned the product lineup preview and the news section.</p>

                    </div>
                    <h4>Outcome</h4>
                    <p>Design elements like the navigation and buttons were updated and standardized, and the overall layout was slightly altered to allow for a more breathable experience.</p>
                    <p>The vehicle lineup previewer was also changed to provide space between videos. It also allows the user to view models as if they were in a showroom, cycling through models and understanding their variants easily.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the "Stories" and "News" sections were combined and redesigned to be less confusing.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="project-section">
                    <p>This was a quick design exercise that I had a lot of fun with! While this wasn't a full UX study, nor a complete redesign, I found it interesting to see what kind of change could be made by adjusting the right design elements.</p>
                    <p>Mini-studies like these help me gain a better appreciation for the fundamentals of UI, and how subtle changes can significantly effect a brand image.</p>
