                <h3>The goal for any infotainment system should be to convey information to the user in a way that does not interfere with their driving. In order to create a hierarchy of information by which I would design accordingly, I started with mapping the user journey.</h3>                <h3>Additionally, I did competitive research to determine what other brands prioritized in their screens. My initial research gave me some great initial goals:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Create a new gauge cluster screen capable of displaying a full-screen map</li>
                    <li>Conceptualize dual-screen functionality in the gauge cluster screen</li>
                    <li>Reorganize elements in the infotainment screen to make better use of the available space</li>
                    <li>Refine the current design language to convey Volvo's functional but luxurious brand image</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>After preliminary sketches, I started by recreating the current gauge cluster. It was important that I had this version prototyped for user testing down the road.</h3>
                <h3>Since I planned to give users the ability to display two things at once, I needed to make sure space wasn't going to be an issue. I created multiple versions of each screen element to see what it would look like inside the gauge cluster. I also created the more liminal elements that would be viewed by a driver when modifying their display.</h3>                <h3>It was very important to me that I represented not only the different display types, but the menus a driver would need to navigate to get there. A driver should be able to scroll through a menu almost subconciously; the driver should not have to split their attention between the road and the interior screens.</h3>
                <h3>Users would also be able to pick up apps and drag them to their homescreen widget or just reorganize them in a style similar to a smart phone. In my opinion, car interiors with large center screens (especially those oriented vertically) should follow the UX of mobile devices since it's already what a user will expect from a touchscreen.</h3>

                <h3>After iterating on my designs for a week, I was happy with my solution. But what does that matter? I needed to put my design to the test with user research.</h3>
                <h3>In order to properly simulate the operation of a gauge cluster screen, I made a digital version of the steering wheel controls. I had my participants use these controls to navigate the gauge cluster, which I positioned relative to the wheel. I also recreated Volvo's current infotainment system to compare to my own.</h3>
                <h3>With everything in place, I was able to test whether my changes had benefited or detracted from the overal user experience. I used A/B testing to determine which gauge cluster was the most favorable regarding useablility and aesthetics, tested 10 different subjects on their ability to execute basic tasks, then conducted a survey on user's likes and dislikes of the new system. In the end, these were the results:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>8/10 of users were able to identify and toggle between two gauge cluster displays with no mistakes</li>
                    <li>Users overwhelmingly favored the ability to display two things at once in the gauge cluster</li>
                    <li>Users performed basic climate control tasks on my screen 4 seconds faster than with Volvo's infotainment screen on average</li>
                    <li>While initially unsure about the steering wheel controls, 9/10 users favored them compared to Volvo's</li>

                <h3>I was pretty pleased with the outcome of this project. It's a smaller case study, but it has to do with an area of UX that I'm particularly passionate about.</h3>
                <h3>It was fun to try and navigate user testing for multiple screens that had to be navigated by a separate set of controls. Having to design screens that can be controlled in multiple ways adds a layer of complexity that I appreciate. I also just loved designing the small details of each screen.</h3>
                <h3>Even though Volvo has updated their infotainment screen since the start of this project, I still think I made some very important tweaks, and I certainly improved the functionality of the gauge cluster. As more cars move towards fully digital dashes, I'm excited to see what innovations will look like.</h3>
                <h3>Just from this project alone, I can say I really do enjoy watching people's initial reactions to controls/screen layouts. It's extremely satisfying to see your decisions change how users interact with their car.</h3>
